Instructions:

1. Create a new Python file named "turtle_tf_broadcaster.py" and paste the skeleton code provided.
2. Make the file executable with chmod +x turtle_tf_broadcaster.py.
3. Launch the Turtlesim node using the command: rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node.
4. Run the skeleton Python code using the command: ./turtle_tf_broadcaster.py.
5. Monitor the TF transformations using the command: rosrun tf tf_echo /world /turtle.

Task for the students:

1. Familiarize yourself with the skeleton code provided.
2. Modify the skeleton code to handle multiple turtles.
3. Create a simple Python script that subscribes to the TF transformations and calculates the distance between two turtles.
4. (Optional) Implement a leader-follower behavior between two turtles using the calculated distance.
